# FAQ
### What is LegacyWare?
LegacyWare is the proposed name for a project aimed to provide software downloads for almost everything (and almost every version). Fed up with the latest designs and features no more!

### When will this release?
Sometime. Don't know when. I am currently in a year at school where I need to focus on school all the time. Exam year, yes.

### Will it look nice?
It will look lovely. Period. Material Design, first iteration. What's more to love?

### Will it contain paid software
Probably. Whether you should download and install it though is up to you.
